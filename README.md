# Próximo: AI-Powered Wealth Management Engine

**Próximo** (Spanish for *Future/Next*) is an innovative, AI-driven wealth management and investment optimization platform designed for the Garanti BBVA **"Genç Fikrinle Parla"** Idea Competition. It specifically targets the financial needs of Generation Z (ages 18-26) by transforming traditional banking into a personalized, social, and automated experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project Status:** This repository contains a **frontend prototype** developed to showcase the vision and user experience (UX) of Próximo. While the backend architecture (AI engine and microservices) is currently presented as a theoretical engineering model, the frontend demonstrates the end-to-end user flow intended for a production environment.

## Key Concept & Features

Próximo is built on three pillars of financial engineering and behavioral science:

* **Yield-Optimizer (AI Core):** Uses **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and Genetic Algorithms to optimize a user's fund basket weekly based on their risk profile (Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive).
* **Social Proof & Peer-Validation:** A "Top 1%" social dashboard that allows users to see and (anonymously) copy the fund distributions of the most successful investors in their age or professional group.
* **Bonus-to-Investment (Nudge Engine):** Implements **Nudge Theory** by automatically converting Garanti BBVA Bonus points into investment fund units (e.g., GHS, TTE), turning small rewards into long-term wealth.

## Academic & Engineering Foundation

The project moves beyond simple UI by grounding its logic in proven financial and behavioral models:

* **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT):** Optimizes the efficient frontier to maximize returns for a given risk level.
* **Nudge Theory (Richard Thaler):** Uses "choice architecture" to encourage better financial habits without restricting freedom of choice.
* **Sharpe Ratio Optimization:** A technical metric used to calculate the return of an investment compared to its risk.
